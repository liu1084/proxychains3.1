ProxyChains ver 3.1 README
======================

This is Unix version only.

How to mess with sources - How to Install : read INSTALL !!!!!!

This program forces any tcp connection made by any given tcp client
to follow through proxy (or proxy chain). It is a kind of proxifier.
It acts like sockscap / permeo / eborder driver ( intercepts TCP calls )
It is FREE.

This version (3.x) introduces support for DNS resolving through proxy 
it supports SOCKS4, SOCKS5 and HTTP CONNECT proxy servers.
Auth-types: socks - "user/pass" , http - "basic".

When to use it ?
1) When the only way to get "outside" from your LAN is through proxy server.
2) To get out from behind restrictive firewall which filters outgoing ports.
3) To use two (or more) proxies in chain:
	like: your_host <--> proxy1 <--> proxy2 <--> target_host
4) To "proxify" some program with no proxy support built-in (like telnet)
5) Access intranet from outside via proxy.
5) To use DNS behind proxy.

Some cool features:

* This program can mix different proxy types in the same chain
	like: your_host <-->socks5 <--> http <--> socks4 <--> target_host
* Different chaining options supported
	random order from the list ( user defined length of chain ).
	exact order  (as they appear in the list )
	dynamic order (smart exclude dead proxies from chain)
* You can use it with any TCP client application, even network scanners
	yes, yes - you can make portscan via proxy (or chained proxies)
	for example with Nmap scanner by fyodor (www.insecire.org/nmap).
	proxychains nmap -sT -PO -p 80 -iR  (find some webservers through proxy)
* You can use it with servers, like squid, sendmail, or whatever.
* DNS resolving through proxy.

Configuration:
proxychains looks for config file in following order:
1)	./proxychains.conf
2)	$(HOME)/.proxychains/proxychains.conf
3)	/etc/proxychains.conf  **

**see more in /etc/proxychains.conf

Usage Example:

	bash$ proxychains telnet targethost.com

in this example it will run telnet through proxy(or chained proxies)
specified by proxychains.conf

Usage Example:

	bash$ proxyresolv targethost.com

in this example it will resolve targethost.com through proxy(or chained proxies)
specified by proxychains.conf

NOTE: 
- to run suid/sgid programs(like ssh) through proxychains you have to be root
- this version has add localnet patch, so proxychains will direct to local net.
For example:
add localnet 192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0 to proxychains.conf

- if you want to install the version, the error will be show like "getnameinfo",
make sure you comment system netdb.h function `getnameinfo`, and uncomment this file
after you compile proxychains3.1.

- Another version:
proxychains has been location SF site, Now ng version is on [github.com](https://github.com/liu1084/proxychains-ng), which has a patch for local network.
